Qdrant Vector Search API with FastAPI and SentenceTransformers
---

This project demonstrates how to build a simple question-answer API using vector search with Qdrant, sentence embeddings generated by SentenceTransformers, and a FastAPI backend.
## Features
- Converts user questions into semantic embeddings using SentenceTransformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model)
- Stores and searches embeddings in Qdrant vector database
- Returns the most semantically similar answer for user queries
- Simple REST API built with FastAPI

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emrealtin/faq-with-qdrant.git
cd faq-with-qdrant
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn sentence-transformers qdrant-client
```

3. Run Qdrant server locally (requires Docker):

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
```
4. Start the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Send a POST request to the /query endpoint with a JSON body containing your question:
Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/query" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question":"Where is my order?"}'
```

```bash
{
  "answer": "Your order has been shipped.",
  "score": 0.92
}
```
